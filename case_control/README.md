##differential cell type ranking

These analyses use output generated by the gene expression analysis here https://github.com/shendurelab/cfDNA. Average gene expression values summarised by cell type per tissue should be used as input into this analysis.
The correlation.csv output contains cell types ordered by strength of correlation between gene expression and gene-level fast-fourrier transformed window protection scores in the cfDNA sample.
