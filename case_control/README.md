# differential cell type ranking

These case-control analyses use the correlation.csv output generated by the gene expression analysis presented here https://github.com/shendurelab/cfDNA. The gene expression analysis should be performed using average gene expression values summarised by cell type per tissue from the Tabula Sapiens consortium. This gene expression matrix has been provided in data. The correlation.csv output contains cell types ordered by strength of correlation between gene expression and gene-level fast-fourrier transformed window protection scores in the cfDNA sample.
